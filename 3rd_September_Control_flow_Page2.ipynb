    "Like the alternative example for factorial memoization, the output is not the entire dictionary, but just fibMem2(8). Fair enough, if that’s all you need. And the complete dictionary is there - if you insert print(fibdict) right before the return statement you can have a peek. It’s just that you can’t get it out of the function - it gets discarded along with everything else once the final return of fibdict[n] occurs. In this way, it’s identical to how tri was behaving when we first tried to revise pascal()."
